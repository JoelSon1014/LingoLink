- Clean up translation
    - We want to ignore messages like "translate! 5.." or messages from lingolink
    - We want to make the username in the translation to be their server name (e.g "Jamie" or "NOEL"), not their discord username
    - We want to print out the order of the messages in reverse order, with older messages printing out first
- Add text-to-speech feature for translated text
